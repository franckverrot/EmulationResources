

I know of 3 types (SCE,PS-X,CPE), but 2 of them are almost the same, and share most of the 
fields. The CPE structure will be left for another time as i miss some info that is needed to 
start parsing objects. 




typedef struct _EXE_HEADER_ {
	u_byte id[8];
	u_long text;			/* SCE only */
	u_long data;			/* SCE only */
	u_long pc0;
	u_long gp0;			/* SCE only */
	u_long t_addr;
	u_long t_size;
	u_long d_addr;			/* SCE only */
	u_long d_size;			/* SCE only */
	u_long b_addr;			/* SCE only */
	u_long b_size;			/* SCE only */
	u_long s_addr;
	u_long s_size;
	u_long SavedSP;
	u_long SavedFP;
	u_long SavedGP;
	u_long SavedRA;
	u_long SavedS0;
} EXE_HEADER;








Explanation





•ExeType = { 'SCE EXE' || 'PS-X EXE' }; 
•text - Offset of the text segment 
•data - Offset of the data segment 
•pc0 - Program Counter. 
•gp0 - Address of the Global Pointer 
•t_addr - The address where the text segment is loaded 
•t_size - The size of the text segment 
•d_addr - The address where the text segment is loaded 
•d_size - The size of the data segment 
•b_addr - The address of the BSS segment 
•b_size - The size of the BSS segment 
•s_addr - The address of the stack 
•s_size - The size of the stack. 
•SavedXX -The Exec system call saves some registers to these fields before jumping to the program
