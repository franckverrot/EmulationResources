Processor
---------

 The GameBoy uses a computer chip similiar to an Intel 8080.
 It contains all of the instructions of an 8080 except there
 are no exchange instructions. In many ways the processor is
 more similiar to the Zilog Z80 processor. Compared to the
 Z80, some instructions have been added and some have been
 taken away.

 The following are new instructions:

  LDI  (HL),A           ;write a to (hl) and increment hl
  LDD  (HL),A           ;write a to (hl) and decrement hl
  LDI  A,(HL)           ;write (hl) to a and increment hl
  LDD  A,(HL)           ;write (hl) to a and decrement hl
  SWAP r                ;rotate register by 4 bits
  SWAP (HL)             ;rotate (hl) by 4 bits
  LD   A,($FF00+nn)
  LD   A,($FF00+C)
  LD   ($FF00+nn),A
  LD   ($FF00+C),A
? STOP
? LD   (nnnn),SP
  ADD  SP,dd            ;dd=shortint
  LD   HL,SP+dd         ;dd=shortint

 The following instructions have been removed:

  Any command that uses the IX or IY registers.
  All input or output instructions.
  All exchange instructions.
  All commands prefixed by ED (except remapped reti).
  All conditional jumps/calls/rets on parity/overflow and signflag.

Echo of 8kB Internal RAM
------------------------

 The addresses E000-FE00 appear to access the internal RAM
the same as C000-DE00. (i.e. If you write a byte to address
E000 it will appear at C000 and E000. Similarly, writing a
byte to C000 will appear at C000 and E000.)

User I/O
--------

 There are no empty spaces in the memory map for
implementing input ports except the switchable RAM bank
area (not an option on the Super Smart Card since it's
RAM bank is always enabled) and the ROM area from
6000-7FFF when using a ROM that is smaller than 32kB.

 An output only port may be implemented anywhere between
6000-FDFF. If implemented in a RAM area care should be
taken to use an area of RAM not used for anything else.
(FE00 and above can't be used because the CPU doesn't
generate an external /WR for these locations.)

Cart Memory Info
----------------

An internal information area is located at 0100-014F in
each cartridge. It contains the following values: 

0100-0103  This is the begin code execution point in a
           cart. Usually there is a NOP and a JP
           instruction here but not always.

0104-0133  Scrolling Nintendo graphic:

           ( PROGRAM WON'T RUN IF CHANGED!!!)

0134-0143  Title of the game in ASCII. If it is less than
           16 characters then the remaining bytes are
           filled with 00's.

014E-014F  Checksum (higher byte first) produced by
           adding all bytes of a cartridge except for two
           checksum bytes and taking two lower bytes of
           the result. (GameBoy ignores this value.)

Rom Types
---------

The following define the byte at cart location 0147:

 ROM ONLY
  This is a 32kB (256kb) ROM and occupies 0000-7FFF.

 MBC1 (Memory Bank Controller 1)
   Writing a value into 2000-3FFF area will select an
  appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF. Values of 0 and 1
  do the same thing and point to ROM bank 1. Rom bank 0
  is not accessible from 4000-7FFF and can only be read
  from 0000-3FFF.
   Writing a value into 4000-5FFF area will select an
  appropriate RAM bank at A000-C000. Before you can
  read or write to a RAM bank you have to enable it by
  writing a 0A into 0000-1FFF area*. To disable RAM bank
  operations write a 00 into 0000-1FFF area. Disabling a
  RAM bank probably protects that bank from false writes
  during power down of the GameBoy.

  * NOTE: The Super Smart Card doesn't require this
   operation because it's RAM bank is ALWAYS enabled.
   Include this operation anyway to allow your code
   to work with both.

 MBC2 (Memory Bank Controller 2):
   Same as MBC1 except RAM switching is not provided.

Power Up Sequence
-----------------

  When the GameBoy is powered up, a 256 byte program
 starting at memory location 0 is executed. This program
 is located in a ROM inside the GameBoy. The first thing
 the program does is read the cartridge locations from
 $104 to $133 and place this graphic of a Nintendo logo
 on the screen at the top. This image is then scrolled
 until it is in the middle of the screen. Two musical
 notes are then played on the internal speaker. Again,
 the cartridge locations $104 to $133 are read but this
 time they are compared with a table in the internal rom.
 If any byte fails to compare, then the GameBoy stops
 comparing bytes and simply halts all operations. If all
 locations compare the same, then the GameBoy starts
 adding all of the bytes in the cartridge from $134 to
 $14d. A value of 25 decimal is added to this total. If
 the least significant byte of the result is a not a
 zero, then the GameBoy will stop doing anything. If it
 is a zero, then the internal ROM is disabled and
 cartridge program execution begins at location $100
 with AF=$01B0, BC=$0013, DE=$00D8, HL=$014D and
 Stack Pointer=$FFFE.

Video
-----

  The main GameBoy screen buffer (aka background) consists
 of 256x256 pixels or 32x32 tiles (8x8 pixels each). Only
 160x144 pixels can be displayed on the screen. Registers
 SCROLLX and SCROLLY hold the coordinates of background to
 be displayed in the left upper corner of the screen.
 Background wraps around the screen (i.e. when part of it
 goes off the screen, it appears on the opposite side.) 

  An area of VRAM known as Background Tile Table contains
 the numbers of tiles to be displayed. It is organized as
 32 rows of 32 bytes each. Each byte contains a number of
 a tile to be displayed. Tile patterns are taken from the
 Tile Pattern Table located either at 8000-8FFF or
 8800-97FF. In the first case, patterns are numbered with
 unsigned numbers from 0 to 255 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at
 address 8000). In the second case, patterns have signed
 numbers from -128 to 127 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at address
 9000). The Tile Pattern Table address for the background
 can be selected via LCDC register. 

  Besides background, there is also a "window" overlaying
 the background. The window is not scrollable i.e. it is
 always displayed starting from its left upper corner. The
 location of a window on the screen can be adjusted via
 WNDPOSX and WNDPOSY registers. Screen coordinates of the
 top left corner of a window are WNDPOSX-7,WNDPOSY. The
 tile numbers for the window are stored in the Window Tile
 Table in the same way as background tiles are stored in
 the Background Tile Table. The tile patterns are taken
 from the table at 8800-97FF and therefore have unsigned
 numbers.

  Both background and window can be disabled or enabled
 separately via bits in the LCDC register.

  The tile images are stored in the Tile Pattern Tables.
 Each 8x8 image occupies 16 bytes, where each 2 bytes
 represent a line:

  Tile:                                     Image:

  .33333..                     .33333.. -> 01111100 -> 7Ch
  22...22.                                 01111100 -> 7Ch
  11...11.                     22...22. -> 00000000 -> 00h
  2222222. <-- digits                      11000110 -> C6h

  ........                                 11111110 -> FEh
                               33...33. -> 11000110 -> C6h
                                           11000110 -> C6h
                               22...22. -> 00000000 -> 00h
                                           11000110 -> C6h
                               11...11. -> 11000110 -> C6h
                                           00000000 -> 00h
                               ........ -> 00000000 -> 00h
                                           00000000 -> 00h

  As it was said before, there are two Tile Pattern Tables
 at 8000-8FFF and at 8800-97FF. The first one can be used
 for sprites and the background. Its tiles are numbered
 from 0 to 255. The second table can be used for the
 background and the window display and its tiles are
 numbered from -128 to 127. 

Sprites
------

  GameBoy video controller can display up to 40 sprites
 either in 8x8 or in 8x16 pixels. Because of a limitation
 of hardware, only ten sprites can be displayed per scan
 line. Sprite patterns have the same format as tiles, but
 they are taken from the Sprite Pattern Table located at
 8000-8FFF and therefore have unsigned numbers. Sprite
 attributes reside in the Sprite Attribute Table (aka OAM)
 at FE00-FE9F. OAM is divided into 40 4-byte blocks each
 of which corresponds to a sprite. Blocks have the
 following format:

  Byte0  Y position on the screen, values beyond 16 will start out of screen
  Byte1  X position on the screen, values beyond 8 will start out of screen
  Byte2  Pattern number 0-255 [always unsigned, data at 8000-8FFF]
         When sprite size 8x16 is selected the low-bit is ignored!
  Byte3  Flags:

         Bit7  Priority
               If this bit is set to 1, sprite is displayed
               behind the window and behind colors 1, 2,
               and 3 of the background (i.e. sprite only
               prevails over background color 0). Otherwise,
               sprite is shown in front of the background and
               in front or behind the window depending on the
               window priority bit (see LCDC bit 1).

         Bit6  Y flip
               Sprite pattern is flipped vertically if
               this bit is set to 1.
         Bit5  X flip
               Sprite pattern is flipped horizontally if
               this bit is set to 1.
         Bit4  Palette number
               Sprite colors are taken from OBJ1PAL if
               this bit is set to 1 and from OBJ0PAL
               otherwise.

Sound
-----

  There are two sound channels connected to the output
 terminals SO1 and SO2. There is also a input terminal Vin
 connected to the cartridge. It can be routed to either of
 both output terminals. GameBoy circuitry allows producing
 sound in four different ways:

   Quadrangular wave patterns with sweep and envelope functions
   Quadrangular wave patterns with envelope functions
   Voluntary wave pattern
   White noise

  These four sounds can be controlled independantly and
 then mixed separately for each of the output terminals. 

Timer
-----

  Sometimes it's useful to have a timer that interrupts at
 regular intervals for routines that require periodic or
 percise updates. The timer in the GameBoy has a selectable
 frequency of 4096, 16384, 65536, or 262144 Hertz. This
 frequency increments the Timer Counter (TIMA). When it
 overflows, it generates an interrupt. It is then loaded
 with the contents of Timer Modulo (TMA). The following
 are examples:

 ;This interval timer interrupts 4096 times per second

     ld  a,$ff
     ldh (6),a     ;Set TMA to divide clock by 1
     ld  a,4
     ldh (7),a     ;Set clock to 4096 Hertz

 ;This interval timer interrupts 65536 times per second

     ld  a,256-4
     ldh (6),a     ;Set TMA to divide clock by 4
     ld  a,5
     ldh (7),a     ;Set clock to 262144 Hertz

                          0 = off (stays at Initial Volume)
                          n = Increment/Decrement Volume each n*15.6ms

              Example (Release):
              Assume Initial Volume 5, Direction=Decrease, Rate=4.
              The envelope will start at 5 and decrement by one each 62.4ms.
              Past 312ms (5*62.4ms) the sound is completely faded out.

              Example (Attack):
              Initial Volume 5, Direction Increase, Rate=1 (fastest).
              Envelope will start at 5, increments by one each 15.6ms.
              Past 156ms ( (15-5)*15ms ) sound reaches maximum volume (15).
              If EG (FF14.6) is xxx it will stay at 15. If EG is xxx it will
              immediately went off past max volume was reached.

              Example (Envelope off):
              Initial Volume 10, Direction=Don't Care, Rate=0 (off).
              Depending on EG the sound will stay at volume 10, or went

            indicate the V-Blank period. Writing will
            reset the counter.

            This is just a RASTER register. The current
            line is thrown into here. But since there are

   The DMA Transfer (40*28 bit) from internal ROM or RAM
   ($0000-$F19F) to the OAM (address $FE00-$FE9F) can be
   performed. It takes 152 microseconds for the transfer.

   40*28 bit = #140  or #$8C.  As you can see, it only
   transfers $8C bytes of data. OAM data is $A0 bytes
   long, from $0-$9F.

   But if you examine the OAM data you see that 4 bits are
   not in use.
   
   40*32 bit = #$A0, but since 4 bits for each OAM is not
   used it's 40*28 bit.

   It transfers all the OAM data to OAM RAM.

   The DMA transfer start address can be designated every
   $100 from address $0000-$F100. That means $0000, $0100,
   $0200, $0300....

    As can be seen by looking at register $FF41 Sprite RAM
   ($FE00 - $FE9F) is not always available. A simple routine
   that many games use to write data to Sprite memory is shown
   below. Since it copies data to the sprite RAM at the appro-
   priate times it removes that responsibility from the main
   program. This routine is usually put into high RAM ($FF80 -
   $FFFE) and called from a VBlank Interrupt:

   Example program:

VBlank:
      push af        <- Save A reg & flags
      ld a,BASE_ADRS <- transfer data from BASE_ADRS
      ld ($ff46),a   <- put A into DMA registers
      ld a,28h       <- loop length
Wait:                <- We need to wait 152.5 microseconds.
      dec a          <-  4 cycles - decrease A by 1
      jr nz,Wait     <- 12 cycles - branch if Not Zero to Wait
      pop af         <- Restore A reg & flags
      reti           <- Return from interrupt

    The most likely reason that it is put into high RAM is so
   that the BASE_ADRS may be changed dynamically by writing a
   new value directly into RAM. This would serve to keep this
   interrupt routine to an absolute minimum execution-time wise.

   Name     - BGP
   Contents - BG Palette Data  (W)

              Bit 7-6 - Data for Dot Data 11
              Bit 5-4 - Data for Dot Data 10
              Bit 3-2 - Data for Dot Data 01
              Bit 1-0 - Data for Dot Data 00

              This selects the shade of gray you what for
              your BG pixel. Since each pixel uses 2 bits,
              the corresponding shade will be selected
              from here. The Background Color (00) lies at
              Bits 1-0, just put a value from 0-$3 to
              change the color.

              This selects the colors for sprite palette 0.
              It works exactly as BGP ($FF47).
              See BGP for details.

FF4A
   Name     - WY
   Contents - Window Y Position  (R/W)

              0 <= WY <= 143

              WY must be greater than or equal to 0 and
              must be less than or equal to 143.

FF4B
   Name     - WX
   Contents - Window X Position (plus seven) (R/W)

              7 <= WX <= 166

              WX must be greater than or equal to 7 and
              must be less than or equal to 166.

              Lets say WY = 70 and WX = 87 = 80+7.
              The window would be positioned as so:

               0          80         159

----------------------------
nocash hackwork and additions

- rst 60h called on all changes on selected joypad keylines (not only hi2lo)
- joypad keylines are selecting by writing a 0 to de keyline bit (not a 1)
- added key names right at joypad bit description
- removed overkilled joypad description blablabla
- call,jump,ret on parity/overflow,sign-flags were removed
- ed-prefixed commands were removed (except remapped reti)
- new instructions are ...
- added opcode list
- added char resolution (gameboy specs)
- (0149)=0 -> ram size 0 Byte or 512 Byte
- added sprite origin (x=8, y=16)
- added sprites of 8x16 ignore low-bit of sprite number (castlevania adv. etc)
- fixed the wx=80 (instead of 87) bug in window schematic
- made lcd stat description less confusing (mode 2 same than 10 means what?)
- think FF25.0 will enable channel 1 (not 0)
- lcdcont sounded like continue, replaced as lcdc (lcdctrl would be fine, too)
- wave duty described as (__--) instead of 50% only
- snd freq means 133333Hz/(2048-xx)
- snd len (FF11.0-5) is stupid, bits are unused
- described FF24.volume as read only, described FF26.0-3 as read only
- named sound registers as CH1_ENV etc. instead of NR10 etc.
- renamed initial to kick. renamed count/consec. to stay and added description
- named sound channels as channel 1..4 (not as mode 1..4)

----------------------------
nocash hackwork and additions (opcode list)

- added undefined opcodes
- corrected ld hl,sp+dd (not ld hl,(sp+dd)
- extended * to nn, nnnn or dd/disp (especially add sp,dd (not add sp,*))
- commented all changes to z80
- made it look friendlier
