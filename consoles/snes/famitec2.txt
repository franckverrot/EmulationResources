Version 1.1

Corrected an error in screen sizes and removed a quesry on sound registers.


Corsair + Kari presents the first dox of Fami hardware register
locations and brief explanation of them..

If you would like to add any info found in this list please leave
a mail message to Corsair or RamRaider on GRAVEYARD BBS +44-91-5160560
or anything to do with the FAMICON/SNES..

We have an INTERNET address if ya want it leave true e-mail!

Or better still if ya can get the Programmers handbook (Both) please call
and leave mail :) , or even the 100,000 quid SCSI SNASM board for FAMICON
development :)

Also if you want more info contact us the same way..

We are esp looking for contacts to help get to grips with this new platform
everybody welcome!

Special greetings to Starr/QUARTEX and any other True Console Dude! 

coming soon is some sound chip info........

 7d     2100-2142(?)    Videochip Registers
        4300-437f       DMA Registers

        8000-ffff       ROM:This contains 32k block of game ROM.
                            So, the games are divided to 32k chunks
                            which locate always at address $8000-$ffff,
                            but in different banks. This means that the first
                            32k of game is at $008000-$00ffff and next 32k
                            is at $018000-$01ffff etc.

 7e     0000-1fff       Lo RAM (same as always at $0000-$1fff)  \
        2000-ffff       RAM    \ I'm not sure about              } 128k RAM??
 7f     0000-ffff       RAM    / this RAM                       /

 7f-ff  all             Not used???

$ffec($fffc) contains reset vector and $ffea($fffa) is NMI vector. The NMI is
actually vertical blank interrupt.

Screen Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Famicom Tile format is simple. Each Tile is 4 planes and 8x8 bits.
32 bytes are used per Tile .

PLANES 1  &  2                  PLANES  3  &    4
    byte0   byte1                  byte 16   byte 17  
    byte2   byte3                  byte 18   byte 19
    byte4   byte5                  byte 20   byte 21
     .....                              .......
    byte14  byte15                 byte 30   byte 31

Screen Map
~~~~~~~~~~
Famicom can use only Tiles $0-$3ff, max 1024 chars.
16 bits:   YX?c ccNN NNNN NNNN
           fedc ba98 7654 3210

  Y = mirror y     X = mirror x   ?=unknown
  ccc = palette nr (8 palettes)   NN.. = character number

Screen Resolution is normally 32x32 chars but only the first 30 y blocks are 
visible (until scrolled) - 64 bytes / line

Screen VRAM Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Screen Width 32x32 offset for x,y       0,0   = 0

Screen Width 64x32 offset for x,y       0,0   = 0
                                        33,0  = $400

Screen Width 32x64 offset for x,y       0,0   = 0
                                        0,33  = $400 

Screen Width 64x64 offset for x,y       0,0   = 0
                                        33,0  = $400
                                        0,33  = $800
                                        33,33 = $c00

As can be seen if a wider mode is selected the extra height/width follow
after the main screen in memory.
