     OVERVIEW<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     Uwaoo!  Hi.  I'm Gau.  Me have a shiny thing.  Very shiny...
     shiny... shiny...  A little *shiny* box inside my SNES.  It's
     called an SPC-700.  This little shiny thing makes noise when
     told to do so by code inside the SNES.  This little gizmo
     is the key to making any sound whatsoever with your SNES
     program.<p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">
     WHAT IS THE SPC<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     The SPC-700 is a co-processor.  This means it is a separate
     CPU inside the SNES with its own memory and instruction set.
     The SNES communicates with the SPC through four 8-bit I/O
     ports.  When the appropriate information is sent on the I/O
     ports, the program in the SPC will recognize the signals and
     perform some action (it might be nothing at all).<p>

     The SPC has its own memory, instruction set, etc.  You cannot
     put a program into the SPC simply by storing it into RAM.  The
     SPC must be sent the program via it's I/O locations.  When you
     first turn on the SNES, the SPC has an internal kernal of sorts
     that gives it the ability to bootstrap to a program sent over
     the I/O port.  Provided you have such a program, you can send
     it to the SPC.  When the SPC recieves your code it will jump to
     the execution address in  its memory that you specify (it's not
     required to be the start of code).  This is where your program
     gets control of the SPC, DSP and I/O ports.<p>

     The memory on the SPC is 64K (kilobytes that is, not kilobits)
     in size.  The DSP is 16-bit and supports eight stereo channels,
     each independantly pannable Left to Right.  Samples sent into
     the DSP aren't the normal raw smapling used on an Amiga or PC.
     The samples in the SPC are encoded in a compressed format (I
     will get more to that later).  The designers only placed 32K
     of RAM into the SPC however, so the upper 32K is unusable.<p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">
     GETTING A PROGRAM INTO THE SPC<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     When the SPC starts, it waits for a startup value to appear
     in location 2141,  This is hexadecimal $CC.  However, you must
     do this last or else the kernal will get incorrect location
     and size information.  Before I go too much further with this,
     I should indicate the block structure the SPC recognizes as
     part of the transfer protocol:<p>
<!--mstheme--></font><pre>
     WORD  Length
     WORD  Location
     BYTES Data
</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana">
     The SPC kernal will let you send any number of these blocks (ie:
     a MIDI implementation might use this to load appropriate patches
     for a song about to be played and then send the song).<p>

     When you've sent all blocks and want to start running code
     in the SPC, you send a zero-length block.  There won't be
     any data.  This block which contains only a 0 for length and
     a location will tell the kernal in the SPC that you're done
     sending and that it should jump to the program you just sent.
     The section below refers to this as the terminator block.<p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">
    SENDING THE BLOCKS<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     The transfer protocol is fairly straightforward.
<ol>
<li>    Get the length and place it into a counter
<li>    Get the location and store it to $2142-3 (a 16-bit
        operation will work fine).
<li>    If this is the first chunk, place $CC into $2140 and start
        an 8-bit sent-count at zero.
<li>    Send $01 to $2140 unless this is the terminator block,
        in which case you store a zero here.
<li>    You send the rest of the block one byte at a time.  Store
        the byte into $2140.
<li>    To tell the SPC you've sent it the next value, you tell it
        the curent location.  The SPC will set it to one less than
        the number of the curent byte sent (SPC starts this location
        at $FF and will wait for this location to go zero).  Use the
        8-bit sent-count.  Store the sent-count to $2141
<li>    Wait for $2140 to mimic the value you just put into $2141.
        Please compare this with your counter and NOT the I/O port.
<li>    Bump the sent-count
<li>    Go back to step 5 until all bytes are sent.
<li>    Add 3 to your sent-count
<li>    If this makes the count 0, add 3 again.
<li>    If this wasn't a terminator block, go back to
        step 4 to continue sending blocks.
<li>    You are done and the SPC should now be doing your code.
</ul>

     ONCE YOUR PROGRAM IS IN<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     Okay, so you've got an SPC program in the SPC, now what?
     First your program should have some means of accepting input
     from the SNES when it wants to change game music or play a sound
     effect.  To do this, you need to be able to read or write values
     from or onto the I/O port from the SPC.  On the SNES 65816 side,
     the I/O ports $2140-$2143.  Inside the SPC, they're zero page
     locations $f4-$f7.  Location $f4 is $2140, $f5 is $2141, etc.<p>

     Your code will want to check these ports.  Your SPC program should
     detect values by writing a sentinel value to the port and wait for
     it to change.  Then call the appropriate routine or effect the
     appropriate change.  The reciever should have the task of
     using the sentinel to detect a change.  If all the values are
     important, use two ports, send the byte out both ports and wait
     for the exclusive-or complement of the value sent to show up at
     one of the ports.  This will be the reciever telling you it has
     recieved the next byte ok.  The reciever should wait for both
     locations to become equivalent before attempting to get the next
     byte.  This will ensure the reciever that the sender has placed
     a value onto the port.<p>

     Next, your program will want to make some noise to tell the
     world (and you) that it's there.  To do this, you need to
     know about the SPC's samples and registers.  I'll start with
     the registers, then talk about the samples.<p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">
     THE SPC-700 REGISTERS<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     These registers are directly accessible from your SPC code.
     They are the zeropage locations $f1-$ff.
<!--mstheme--></font><pre>
     $F1       SPCCON1   bits 0-2 timer enables (1=on), bits 4-5
                         are I/O port clear bits (11=clear all)

     $F2       SPCDRGA   DSP Register Address latch.  Write a value
                         here to select a DSP register to read or
                         modify.  This register itself is write-
                         only.

     $F3       SPCDDAT   DSP Register Data register.  Read or write
                         this register to read/write the DSP register
                         currently referred to in SPCDRGA.

     $FA-$FC   SPCTMLT   Timer latches - place a value into the
                         registers.  The timer counts up to your
                         time from 0.  When it hits, the associated
                         SPCTMCT register will advance.

     $FD-$FF   SPCTMCT   4-bit counters count timer hits on each
                         timer respectively

     Note: Timer 2 ($FC,$FF) counts at 64 kHz while the other two
	   count at 8 kHz.

     SPC-700 SAMPLES<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     The samples for the SPC are stored in a compressed format known as
     BRR.  Unlike raw samples, the SPC samples are divided into 9-byte
     blocks.  Each block encodes the equivalent of 16 raw 16-bit samples.
     The block format is as follows:<p>
<!--mstheme--></font><pre>
     rrrrffle 01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef

          rrrr - granularity (known in SPC dox as &quot;range&quot;), 0-12
            ff - filter designation
</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana">
             These are normally zero but have significance on the
             LAST block:
<!--mstheme--></font><pre>
             l - loop flagbit
             e - last chunk of sample
</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana">
     To convert a raw sample, it must first be padded to a multple of 16
     and converted to a 16-bit signed waveform.<p>

     The granularity indicates the quantization level used for this block.
     Higher granularity values indicate SMALLER shifts in amplitude for
     the BRR nybbles in this block.  Since a nybble only has a dynamic
     range from -8 to 7, the granularity is used to expand this:<p>

     As you can see, the SPC uses 16-bit waveforms.  There is enough
     space in 32K to store 58,240 samples using this compression method
     about 4 seconds at 14.4 KHz (sorry, there's not quite enough space
     to do a real good CD quality sound track), ah, but then there's
     always the cartridge memory (24 MBits would hold 5.5 million
     samples - since the transfer gets a speed faster than playback
     you could double buffer and send stuff this way - this would give
     you about 6.5 minutes of digitized sound at CD quality in monaural
     recording.  Stereo would halve these times).<p>

     To convert you look at the raw sample 16 samples at a time.  For all
     waveform points in this sample you find a range (above) that fits
     in all the points.  This is your granularity.  You then use the step
     value to quantize each point down to one nybble.  Then string these
     nybbles together, left to right.  When this is done, you just create
     the header byte and append the eight additional bytes from the nybbles
     you just obtained.  This has just converted 16 bytes of your sample
     to BRR format (Yay hoo!).  Repeat the above procedure for the rest
     of the raw sample.<p>

     When recording for music, keep the recording rate at about 30 Khz to
     ensure that using the pitch value will give you a broad tonal range
     when using that sample as an instrument.  You can forgo (skip) this
     rule if you're using multiple patching of the instrument to counter
     envelope and timbre distortion (but you still have to keep this in
     mind however) [BTW: multiple patching means recording the instrument
     several times, playing the instrument at different octaves for each
     recording] you then match the right patch to the playback octave when
     performing music (ie: on the SPC).<p>

     A higher recording rate gives better results after BRR conversion, 
     as does using 16-bit samples as opposed to 8-bit samples.<p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">
     SPC-700 CODING<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

     The SPC-700 is a processor.  That means that, just like the 68000,
     the SPC follows a program placed in its memory.  This means to do
     music, you must either use a predefined routine from someone else or
     learn SPC-700 machine code.  The latter isn't all that bad (the SPC
     instructions set kicks butt over the 65816's).  There are functions
     for testing individual bits, changing individual bits, doing 16-bit
     BCD, multiplying and dividing.  Additionally, there are also 16-bit
     instructions and the accumulator and Y register combine to form a
     16-bit register (much like H and L on the Z80).<p>

     The easiest way to do SPC700 coding is with an assembler.  However,
     there is a distinct lack of SPC-700 assemblers (as compared to 65816
     assemblers which are all over the place).  However the Famidev site
     has one good shareware assembler called TASM which is a table-based
     assembler (you can change the instruction set it assembles for).
     If you place my instruction set (called TASM07.TAB) into TASM, you
     can assemble SPC-700 code.  The list follows.  It is beyond the scope
     of this overview to go into detail about the SPC 700 assembly.  Maybe
     in another document I will do exactly that.<p>

     Anyhoo, here's the SPC-700 TASM table:<p>
