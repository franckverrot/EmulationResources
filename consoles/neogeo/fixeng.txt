1.- FIX Files

        This document's purpose is to explain how do FIX files work. These
are usually the .378 files on NeoGeo or .FIX on NeoGeo CD.

	Well, FIX files are made by 8x8 pixel blocks. On a file, each pixel corresponds to 4 bits, that means that if we read the first byte, the first pixel will be composed by the first four bits, while the other four correspond to the second pixel.

	Let's see how the first block is supposed to be painted, so you can see it more clear. We first specify "A-" as the four first bits of the byte, and "-A" as the other four. We'll follow alphabetical order to show which byte we are using (AA means first, AB means second, and so on...)
  
	In order to draw the first block, we'll follow the picture:

          0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
        UAAAAAAA¨
      0 3-AQ3AQ-3-AY3AY-3-AA3AA-3-AI3AI-3
        A'
      1 3-AR3AR-3-AZ3AZ-3-AB3AB-3-AJ3AJ-3
        A'
      2 3-AS3AS-3-BA3BA-3-AC3AC-3-AK3AK-3
        A'
      3 3-AT3AT-3-BB3BB-3-AD3AD-3-AL3AL-3
        A'
      4 3-AU3AU-3-BC3BC-3-AE3AE-3-AM3AM-3
        A'
      5 3-AV3AV-3-BD3BD-3-AF3AF-3-AN3AN-3
        A'
      6 3-AW3AW-3-BE3BE-3-AG3AG-3-AO3AO-3
        A'
      7 3-AX3AX-3-BF3BF-3-AH3AH-3-AP3AP-3
        AAAAAAAAU

	And all the other blocks are the same. As all FIX files are 131072 bytes long, they've got 4096n blocks each.
      
	I hope this info to be helpful to you, mainly because there are some FIX viewers on the Internet, but their code is considered TOP-SECRET, and they've got no info, nor source.
    
2.- My VFIX viewer

	The usage of the viewer is very simple. It requires VESA 2.0 and a mouse. It won't run without a mouse.
      
	With mouse buttons you can scroll the file, and to quit you just hve to press a key.

	For example, for Joy Joy Kid, it does like: vfix n022001a.378...and that's all!!!

3.- Credits

	If you want to contact me: kan@arrakis.es

	See you, and remember, if you've got anything about NeoGeo, make everybody know.

4.- Greetings

	First of all, I wanna thank Phobeo(for the translation) and Mario Rodriguez(for his Atlaant emulator).

	I also want to thank Neill Corlett for letting me use his 68000 core in my NeoGeo emulator.

	And of course a greet to all the people of my group TeatreSoft (http:://members.xoom.com/Teatre): EL_POWER, ARGENIS,... Also to all the people at the FIE, like Manogua, Sito, Ramon,etc,etc... And to my dog, of course!!!

	And to finish with it, I want to thank music groups like Helloween, Rage, Dover, and some more that I forget... because without them, programming would be a little bit boring...
